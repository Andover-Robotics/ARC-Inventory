# ARC-Inventory
Inventory management software for [Andover Robotics Club](andoverrobotics.com) that keeps track of all club assets.

**Current Maintainers:** Daniel Ivanovich and Michael Peng

## Summary of Features
This system allows users to add, remove, search for, and keep track of the whereabouts of not only parts needed to build the robots, but any assets of the club. Using Google accounts for authentication, the system manages various levels of access to maintain security. ARC-Inventory was created using Test-Driven Development, and those interested in seeing the test cases should navigate to the Foundation folder. 

When the system is finished, it will be accessible by club members at https://inventory.andoverrobotics.com.

## Suggested Use Cases
ARC-Inventory has a wide variety of possible uses. The original main purpose is to keep track of which parts ARC has, which ones are available, and which are being used for robots.

## Maintenance Needs
- Add new parts into the database each time we buy them
- Remove parts that are broken or otherwise permanently used
- Keep track of which parts are added onto the robot during the building process
- Keep the access levels for club members updated
- Track and update the locations of reorganized or otherwise relocated parts
