# ARC-Inventory
Club inventory management software that keeps track of all club assets.

Programmers:

Summary of Features:
    This system allows users to add, remove, search for, and keep track of the whereabouts of parts needed to build the robot.
- Remove parts
- Search for a part — by what criteria?
- Bill-of-materials? Where if anywhere on GH has Michael put this?
- Identity verification - whitelist
- Created using Test-Driven Development — tests featured in foundation folde

Suggested Uses:
- Keep track of which parts ARC has, which ones are available, and which are being used for robots —> be sure to add new parts
- Create a bill-of-materials to build a certain robot
- Log data on which club members are responsible for certain parts (taking them to a qualifier, home for the summer, etc) and hold them accountable

Maintenance Needs: 

- Add new parts into the database each time we buy them
- Remove parts that are broken or otherwise permanently used 
- Keep track of which parts are added onto the robot during the building process
- Keep the whitelist updated
